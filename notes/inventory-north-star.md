## Problem

Stock is inconsistent between warehouse, storefront, and finance reports. Teams currently trust different systems and spend hours reconciling before every weekly operations review.

## Goal

Ship a single inventory truth with under 0.5% daily variance and under 5-minute propagation lag from warehouse events.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Stock variance under 0.5% for 30 consecutive days
- [ ] Cycle count completion above 95%
- [ ] Manual reconciliation time reduced by 60%
